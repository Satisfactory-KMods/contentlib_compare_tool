  "Name": "Molten Magneatal™",
  "Description": "Melting Point: 1390°C\n\nMagneatal™, FICSIT's internally developed Iron-Nickel-Cobalt (Fernico) alloy, in liquid form.\nIt is ferromagnetic and can be processed into permanent magnets or magnetic cores.\r\rFerrite materials are usually not very resistant to being demagnetized. FICSIT cooperated with K.MODS to create an alloy similar to meteoric iron. When properly refined it is ten times more energy-dense than normal ferrite magnets."
